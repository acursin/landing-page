Creating a landing page based on The Odin Project, to practice basic HTML and CSS

This is a landing page created from a design provided by The Odin Project. By making this, I practiced basic HTML, CSS, and flexbox skills. I aligned and colored items, did basic typography, and implemented very light responsiveness.
